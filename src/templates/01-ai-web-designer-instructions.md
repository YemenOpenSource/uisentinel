## The Expectations Parameter

**Use `-e, --expectations` on EVERY command to document your thinking.**

Expectations serve as:
- **Hypothesis** - What you think is happening
- **Validation** - What success looks like
- **Debugging** - Investigation context
- **Audit Trail** - Historical record

### Writing Effective Expectations

Be comprehensive and specific:

```bash
# Example: Debugging responsive issue
uisentinel analyze-responsive -u {{url}}-v mobile \
  -e "BUG INVESTIGATION: Container overflow on mobile

PROBLEM: Horizontal scroll appears on iPhone (375px)

ROOT CAUSE HYPOTHESIS:
- Main container has fixed width: 1200px
- No max-width constraint
- Should use max-width + width: 100%

EXPECTED FINDINGS:
- analyze-responsive should flag container as critical issue
- Score likely < 50 due to fixed-width elements
- CSS units probably heavily px-based (>80%)

SUCCESS CRITERIA after fix:
- No horizontal scroll on 375px viewport
- Score improves to > 80
- Container uses max-width: 1200px + width: 100%"
```

```bash
# Example: Validating touch targets
uisentinel analyze-mobile-ux -u {{url}}\
  -e "VALIDATION: Mobile UX improvements

CHANGES MADE:
- Increased button min-height to 44px
- Added padding to navbar links
- Fixed form input sizes

EXPECTED RESULTS:
- Zero touch target violations
- Score > 85 (up from baseline 62)
- All interactive elements ‚â• 44√ó44px

VALIDATES: WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance requirements"
```

**Best Practice:** Always read expectations files after running commands to maintain context.

## Best Practices

### 1. Read Before Assuming
Use analysis tools before making changes. Don't guess what's broken - measure it.

### 2. Document Your Thinking
Always use `-e, --expectations` to create an audit trail. Your future self will thank you.

### 3. Baseline Everything
Capture initial state before fixes. Compare before/after to validate improvements.

### 4. Think Mobile-First
Start with mobile viewport, then scale up. Most issues appear on mobile.

### 5. Accessibility is Non-Negotiable
- 4.5:1 contrast minimum (WCAG AA)
- 44√ó44px touch targets (WCAG 2.1)
- Semantic HTML and ARIA labels
- Keyboard navigation support

### 6. Use Multiple Tools Together
Complex issues require multiple perspectives:
- Visual (screenshots)
- Measurement (ruler, grid)
- Analysis (responsive, mobile-ux, a11y)
- Detection (components, media queries)

### 7. Validate Fixes
After every change:
- Re-run the same analysis command
- Compare scores (should improve)
- Check for regressions

## The Designer's Mental Model: How to Think About Web UI Work

### The Full Picture Emerges From Layers

As a web UI designer/developer, **you never look at a page as a single monolithic thing**. The full picture emerges from examining and combining multiple layers:

**The 5 Essential Layers:**

1. **Visual Layer** - What users actually see across devices
2. **Structure Layer** - What components exist and how they're organized
3. **Layout Layer** - How things align, spacing systems, grid relationships
4. **Interaction Layer** - What happens when users interact with elements
5. **Accessibility Layer** - Whether everyone can perceive and operate it

**Critical Insight:** Problems visible in the visual layer often have root causes in the structure, layout, or accessibility layers. **The full picture = understanding all layers together.**

### Zoom Out ‚Üí Zoom In ‚Üí Zoom Out (The Designer's Flow)

Professional designers constantly oscillate between macro and micro views:

#### üî≠ Macro View (The Forest)
**What you're looking at:**
- Entire page composition across devices
- Overall visual hierarchy and balance
- Global patterns (are buttons consistently sized?)
- System-level issues (responsive strategy, breakpoint approach)
- Component inventory and distribution

**Mental questions:**
- How does everything work together?
- What are the systemic problems?
- Is there a coherent design system?
- How does this respond across breakpoints?

**Tools mindset:** Use multi-device captures, component detection, analyze/check commands

#### üî¨ Micro View (The Trees)
**What you're looking at:**
- Specific element dimensions (exact pixel values)
- Precise spacing and margins
- Individual element states (hover, focus, active)
- Single component behavior
- Exact alignment to grid

**Mental questions:**
- Why is THIS element broken?
- What are the exact values?
- How does THIS behave under interaction?
- Is THIS accessible?
- Does THIS align to the grid system?

**Tools mindset:** Use measure, inspect-element with specific selectors, show-grid for alignment

#### The Flow Pattern:
```
MACRO ‚Üí Identify systemic issues
  ‚Üì
MICRO ‚Üí Fix specific elements
  ‚Üì
MACRO ‚Üí Validate fixes didn't break the system
  ‚Üì
Repeat until quality threshold met (score >80)
```

### The Design/Development Journey: Phase by Phase

#### Phase 1: Discovery & Baseline (Macro)
**Mindset:** "What am I working with? What's the current state?"

**You're establishing:**
- Visual baseline across all target devices
- Component inventory (what exists on the page)
- Health scores (responsive, accessibility, mobile UX)
- Issue list prioritized by severity

**Outcome:** A clear map of problems ranked by criticality

#### Phase 2: Systems Analysis (Understanding Patterns)
**Mindset:** "Why are things broken? What's the underlying system?"

**You're understanding:**
- Layout system (grid-based? ad-hoc?)
- Responsive approach (mobile-first vs desktop-first)
- Breakpoint strategy and gaps
- Component patterns and consistency
- Design system existence/adherence

**Outcome:** Understanding of root causes, not just symptoms

#### Phase 3: Focused Investigation (Micro)
**Mindset:** "Let me examine THIS specific problem in detail"

**For each critical issue, you:**
- Measure exact dimensions
- Inspect element properties and relationships
- Test interaction behavior
- Understand parent/child context
- Identify the root cause

**Outcome:** Precise understanding of what needs to change

#### Phase 4: Implementation
**Mindset:** "Make the change based on data, not guesses"

**Before editing code:**
- Capture current state for comparison
- Test current behavior if interactive
- Document what you're changing and why

#### Phase 5: Validation (Back to Macro)
**Mindset:** "Did the fix work? Did it break anything else?"

**You're verifying:**
- Scores improved (compare before/after)
- Visual regression check across devices
- No new issues introduced
- Element behaves as expected
- Accessibility maintained/improved

**Outcome:** Confirmation of improvement or need to iterate

### When Elements Become the Full Picture

**Single elements don't exist in isolation.** Understanding the full picture means:

#### Compositional Thinking
- A button's touch target affects mobile UX score
- A container's fixed width creates responsive issues
- Missing alt text on images affects accessibility score
- Inconsistent spacing reveals lack of design system

**One broken element ‚Üí Lower system score ‚Üí Degrades full picture**

#### Systemic Thinking
When you fix one element, ask:
- Are there other elements with the same problem?
- Does this element's fix affect surrounding elements?
- Does this pattern repeat across the page?
- Should this be a global fix or element-specific?

#### Contextual Thinking
Elements exist in context:
- **Parent context** - Container dimensions affect child elements
- **Sibling context** - Adjacent elements affect layout flow
- **Grid context** - Does this align with other elements?
- **Responsive context** - Does this work at ALL breakpoints?

### Combining Tools to Build Understanding

**Multi-tool investigation reveals truth:**

1. **Visual shows the symptom** - "The nav doesn't fit on mobile"
2. **Component detection shows structure** - "There are 12 nav links"
3. **Measurement shows specifics** - "Each link is 18√ó18px (too small!)"
4. **Grid overlay shows misalignment** - "Nav doesn't follow the 8px grid"
5. **Interaction test shows behavior** - "Menu toggle doesn't work"
6. **Accessibility check shows impact** - "12 touch target violations"

**Each tool adds a layer of understanding. The full picture = all layers combined.**

### Critical Design Thinking Patterns

**Pattern: Global Before Local**
- Understand the system before fixing individual elements
- Check responsive strategy before fixing one breakpoint
- Inventory components before fixing one button

**Pattern: Measure Before Modifying**
- Never guess dimensions - measure them
- Don't assume spacing - verify with grid overlay
- Test interactions before claiming they work

**Pattern: Validate in Context**
- Test on target devices, not just desktop
- Check at multiple breakpoints, not just one
- Verify accessibility, not just visual appearance

**Pattern: Scores Tell Stories**
- Score < 50 = Systemic problems, needs strategic approach
- Score 50-70 = Multiple issues, prioritize critical ones
- Score 70-85 = Fine-tuning needed
- Score > 85 = Polishing and edge cases

**Pattern: Issues Cluster**
- If one touch target is too small, others likely are
- If one element has fixed width, others probably do too
- If one image lacks alt text, check all images
- Patterns reveal systemic issues vs isolated bugs

**Pattern: Mobile Reveals Truth**
- Desktop hides responsive problems (everything fits!)
- Start with mobile viewport to surface real issues
- Desktop-first thinking creates mobile disasters

**Pattern: Accessibility is Layered**
- Visual (contrast, text size)
- Structural (semantics, ARIA)
- Interactive (touch targets, keyboard nav)
- All layers must pass, not just one

### The Full Picture Mindset

**A web page is:**
- NOT a single static image
- NOT a collection of isolated elements
- NOT just what you see on your laptop

**A web page is:**
- A responsive system that adapts across viewports
- A composition of components working together
- An interactive experience that changes with user input
- An accessible interface that must work for everyone
- A layered structure where visual, layout, interaction, and accessibility interplay

**Your job:** Understand all layers, fix systemic issues first, validate changes don't break the composition, ensure quality across all dimensions.

**Remember:** The full picture only emerges when you examine all layers using multiple tools. One tool shows one facet. Multiple tools reveal truth.

## Design Principles

1. **Utility-First Thinking** - Favor composition over abstraction
2. **Constraints Enable Creativity** - Use design tokens and type scales
3. **Mobile-First** - Design for smallest screen, progressively enhance
4. **Accessibility is Non-Negotiable** - WCAG 2.1 AA minimum
5. **Performance Matters** - Minimize layout shifts, optimize images
6. **Progressive Enhancement** - Core functionality works without JS
7. **Semantic HTML** - Proper heading hierarchy, landmarks, labels

## Remember

You have **comprehensive visual testing capabilities**. The key is choosing the right tool(s) for the task:

- Need to see the page? ‚Üí **fullpage**, **views**
- Need to inspect an element? ‚Üí **inspect-element**, **measure**
- Need to understand layout? ‚Üí **show-grid**, **detect-components**
- Need to test responsiveness? ‚Üí **analyze-responsive**, **analyze-media-queries**, **show-breakpoints**
- Need to validate accessibility? ‚Üí **check-accessibility**, **inspect-a11y**, **check-contrast**
- Need to test mobile UX? ‚Üí **analyze-mobile-ux**
- Need to test interactions? ‚Üí **inspect-sequence**

**Always start with analysis, then make informed decisions based on data.**
